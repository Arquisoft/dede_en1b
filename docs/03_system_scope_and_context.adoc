== System Scope and Context

Here we define how the different components of DeDe interact with each other, as well as the technologies the application depends on.

=== Business Context

Actor User
database POD
component CorreosAPI
node DeDe {
  database MongoDB
}
User --> DeDe : Input
User --> POD : Creates and manages
DeDe -u-> User : Returns view / data
DeDe -l-> POD : Requests / updates information
DeDe -r-> CorreosAPI : Places order on checkout
POD --> DeDe : Returns information

|Communication Partner|Input|Output
|User|The user will receive a response from the application (generally a solicited view) via the device the web is being consulted on.|The user will continuously provide input to the application. He is also the one responsible of creating and managing sensitive information in the Solid POD.
|DeDe|The application will receive requests to fulfill from the user, as well as data from both the POD and the MongoDB when required.|The web app will send responses to the user and requests for information to both the POD and Mongo Database. For solicitations to the POD, a login in Solid must be filled by the user. It's integral to the architecture that the data from the POD and the one from MongoDB are handled separately as to not divulge any personal information.
|Solid POD|The user will create the POD to manage his personal information in the app. The application itself, will request for the necessary sensitive data and should always ask for authentication from the user.|The POD will only send personal information to the application, after the appropiate login in Solid.
|MongoDB|The database will accept requests from the application for any information stored (that is, the one we consider not to be personal or sensitive, like the set of products available).|The database will communicate with the application as a response. It will return information that is supposed to be known as public.
|Correos API|The API will accept requests from the application, avoiding interaction with the user as serving to mediate between him and the delivery is the main purpose of the application.|From the API, a response will ideally be given to DeDe when the order has been completed, although this behaviour can be considered optional as making the order is the end goal.

=== Technical Context

DeDe is a decentralized system that follows the architecture of the Solid Project. This means that users are the ones that own and manage the access to their sensitive information, and not the application itself. To handle this, each user will be the owner of a Solid POD (Personal Online Data Store) from which the required information is extracted if needed.

Although the personal data is handled by the PODs, DeDe will also store general information within MongoDB. The application is written in TypeScript, employing the React framework in combination with Material UI for a more polished appearance.

We identify the following technical interfaces:

[options="header", cols="1,2"]
|===
|Technical interface|Description
|Solid Project|Defines the handling of data, which will in turn determine the general structure of the project.
|POD|Personal Online Data Store, it contains sensitive information related to the user so that the provider (DeDe) has no direct access to it without given permission.
|TypeScript|The web development language that will be employed to write our application.
|React|Widespread framework in JavaScript and TypeScript that focuses on handling the views of the application and save time invested on interfaces.
