== System Scope and Context

Here we define how the different components of DeDe interact with each other, as well as the technologies the application depends on.

=== Business Context

|Communication Partner|Input|Output
|User|The user will receive the requested information from the application (generally a solicited view) via the device the web is being consulted on.|The user will continuously interact with the application, requesting the information he needs. The user is also the one responsible of creating and managing some information in the Solid POD, although DeDe will be the one to modify most of the information on its own.
|DeDe|The application will receibe requests to fulfill from the user, as well as data from both the POD and the MongoDB when required.|The web app will send responses to the user and requests to both the POD and MongoDB. For solicitations to the POD, a login in Solid must be filled by the user. It's integral to the architecture that the data from the POD and the one from MongoDB are handled separately as to not divulge any personal information.
|Solid POD|The user will create the POD to manage his personal information in the app. From the application itself, it will be requested to provide data and should always ask for authentication from the user.|The POD will only send personal information to the application, after the appropiate login in Solid.
|MongoDB|The database will accept requests from the application for any information stored (that is, the one we consider not to be personal or sensitive).|The database will communicate with the application as a response to the access to database. It will return information such as the dataon the products offered, or other data that is supposed to be know in public.

=== Technical Context

DeDe is a decentralized system that follows the architecture of the Solid Project. This means that users are the ones that own and manage the access to their sensitive information, and not the application itself. To handle this, each user will be the owner of a Solid POD (Personal Online Data Store) from which the required information is extracted if needed.

Although the personal data is handled by the PODs, DeDe will also store general information within MongoDB. The application is written in TypeScript, employing the React framework for a more polished appearance.

We identify the following technical interfaces:

|===
|Technical interface|Description
|Solid Project|Defines the handling of data, which will in turn determine the general structure of the project.
|POD|Personal Online Data Store, it contains sensitive information related to the user so that the provider (DeDe) has no direct access to it without given permission.
|TypeScript|The web development language that will be employed to write our application.
|React|Widespread framework in TypeScript that focuses on handling the views of the application and save time invested on interfaces.
