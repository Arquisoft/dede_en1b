== Testing
Different testing methods were used to check the correct functioning and implementation of the project.


=== Unitary Tests
We made use of Jest and React testing library. We tried to take into account several tips and good-practises for testing by https://kentcdodds.com[Kent C Dodds], creator of the
react testing library. He has several blogs and videos for teaching React in action. 

Unitary testing had difficulty in the sense that there should not be any dependencies and if they do, they must be mocked for the test. 

We needed to verify that isolated parts of DeDe worked as expected and in some cases it got really hard.

The general strategy used was, in some cases, to put a data-testid in the components we wanted to fetch, or query them by text criteria. 

When the component relied on asynchronous API calls, we mocked their implementation and used functions like waitFor() or waitForElementToBeRemoved(), in order to wait for the end of execution of those functions.

In other cases we had to wrap elements inside others such as MemoryRouter or ReactNotifications before rendering them with the goal of mounting them properly.

In the end, we have 40 test distributed in 19 suites. We tested the following scenarios:
====
* OrderAdminCard component

1. Check that it is rendered properly with a product.
====

====
* AdminLogin component

1. Check that it is rendered properly.
2. Check that when signing-in it calls the API as expected.
====

====
* OrderAdminDetails component

1. Check that it is rendered properly.

====

====
* CartItem component

1. Check that it is rendered correctly.
2. Check that quantity can be modified.
====

====
* ShoppingCart component

1. Check that it is rendered correctly when cart is empty.
2. Check that it is rendered correctly when it has some products.
3. Check that it can have its products deleted calling the corresponding API function.
====

====
* CheckoutItem component

1. Check that it is rendered correctly with a product.
====

====
* Checkout component

1. Check that it is rendered correctly with multiple products.
2. Check that is rendered with the proper information and does not let user go to shipping if the cart is empty.
====


====
* Main Products component

1. Filter is rendered properly.
2. When listing products, the proper function is called and correct products are rendered.
3. When listing products, using filter by color works as expected calling the proper function with corresponding parameters. 
4. When listing products, using filter by brand works as expected.
5. When listing products, using filter by rating works a expected.
====

====
* Product Card component

1. Check that is rendered correctly
2. Check that it handles adding
====

====
* Product Page component

1. Check that it is rendered correctly when the product with given ID exists and it has reviews.
2. Check that it is rendered correctly when the product with given ID does not exist.
3. Check that it is rendered correctly when it has no reviews.
====

====
* Review view component

1. Check that it is rendered correctly
====

====
* Fragments components (NavBar, Footer, AboutUs, DeveloperCards)

1. Check that it is rendered correctly. (One test per fragment)
====

====
* Address Form

1. Check alert is shown when an address field is missing
====
=== Integration Tests

We used Jest and Cucumber to perform integration testing in our app. Thanks to cucumber, we could design integration tests following the famous syntax "Given, When, Then". This allowed for better understandability of the code as well as easier debugging. 

We divided the 8 tests in 5 different suites, who aggregate similar tests. For each on of them, these were the features tested:

====
* Add Address:

Feature: Adding/Changing DedEx Address

Scenario: Adding an address

*    Given A loged in user

*    When They change their address in their profile

*    Then It appears on the shipping page

====

====
* Add to Cart:

Feature: Adding items to the cart

Scenario: Adding one item

* Given A user

* When They add an item to the cart and navigate to the cart

* Then They can see the item


Scenario: Adding an item from product details view

* Given A user

* When They add an item to the cart from the details view of the product and navigate to the cart

* Then They can see the item
====

====
* Buy item:

Feature: Buying products

Scenario: Buying a product

*  Given A user with an item in his cart

*  When They buy it

*  Then The order appears in their profile

====

====
* Product Visualization:

Feature: Visualizing products

Scenario: Main Products view

*  Given An user

*  When They enter the application

*  Then Several Prodcut cards must be shown


Scenario: Product detail view

*  Given An user

*  When They enter the application and click on a product card

*  Then The details view of the selected product must be shown

====

====
* SOLID Login:

Feature: Registering or logging in a new user

Scenario: The user is not registered in the site

*    Given An unregistered user

*    When They press the profile button and log in with their preferred SOLID provider

*    Then Their name should be shown


Scenario: The user is registered in the site

*    Given A registered user

*    When They press the profile button and log in with their preferred SOLID provider

*    Then Their name and orders, if any, should be shown

====

The result of running these test is as follows:

=== Load Tests

Gatling tool was used to perform load tests to the application.
Using its recorder functionality we were able to capture a fixed number of requests and reproduce their functionality for every user that was simulated by the program.

Those requests included the use of filters, adding products to the cart, modifying their quantities and perform checkout functionality. 

The recorder tool acts as a man-in-the-middle to capture the traffic and requests made, we had to modify the proxy configuration in our browsers for the tool to do the before-mentioned actions properly, losing internet connection meanwhile. 

This internet loss made it impossible for us to load test the SOLID login and, as a consequence, the order creation. 

An Open Model for user injection was the one used because you control the arrival rate of users, and the concurrent number of users in our web is not capped. We used this injection setup.

An approximate number of 18k requests were made during the test in which 10% of those had a response time between 800ms and 1200ms, and just 1% had a response time above the latter.

During the test there was a peak of 196 concurrent users.

Observing the percentile response time chart generated we can know where in the execution of the recording the requests consume more time and its different distributions. The requests that consume more time in this test would be filter usage, and quantity modification in the shopping cart.
