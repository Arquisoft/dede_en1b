=== Technical Debts

[%header, cols=2]
|===
|Technical debt
|Explanation

|Lack of knowledge of REACT
|It will be the first time any member of the team uses REACT framework, so some time must be spent learning it, slowing down the development.

|Typescript
|Even though we have some experience with JavaScript, we have never used Typescript, hence there will be a period of adaptation.

|MongoDB
|MongoDB has a non relational scheme, which means that data validation and integrity must be taken into account solely by the developpers.
