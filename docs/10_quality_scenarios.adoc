=== Quality Scenarios

[cols="1,1,1"]
|===
|Quality attribute |QA scenario |Priority

|Privacy
|DeDe must not keep private information of its users, just the bare minimum, using mainly 
each user's SOLID POD for the necessary things.
|High

|Usability
|Every type of user should be able to make use of DeDe. It should be easy to work with,
intuitive, and as accesible as possible. DeDe should also be adaptable to the main platforms used now a days (PC and portable devices).
|High

|Security
|DeDe should take into account the triple A concept: Authentication, Authorization, Accounting.
Special care with the contents shown to each user. Data must never be given to any third party.
|High

|Reliability
|The system should be robust enough so that the most common errors won't make it collapse for extended periods of time.
That is, every type of possible exception should be properly handled. As it is a product for a retail 
company, we must ensure good behaviour and service to its final clients.
|Medium-High

|Efficiency
|The system should work as supposed to with response times under 0.5 - 1 seconds on most of its operations. Any user should be able to make their own purchases with no major problems and without having noticeable delays on response times.
|Medium-High
