|===
|Quality attribute |QA scenario |Priority

|Privacy
|DeDe must not keep private information of its users, just the bare minimum, using mainly 
each user's POD for the necessary things.
|High

|Usability
|Every type of user should be able to make use of DeDe. It should be easy to work with,
intuitive,much accesible as possible. It should also be adaptable to any kind of platform.
|High

|Security
|DeDe should take into account the triple A concept: Authentication, Authorization, Accounting.
Special care with the contents shown to each user. Data must never be given to any third party.
|High

|Reliability
|The system should be so perfectly built that it will never collapse if an error were to be produced.
That is, every type of possible exception should we be properly handled. As it is a product for a retail 
company, we must ensure good behaviour and service to its final clients.
|Medium-High

|Efficiency
|The system should work as supposed to. Any user should be able to make their own purchases with no problem.
|Medium-High
